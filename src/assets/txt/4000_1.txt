The Little 
Red Chicken 


A little red chicken had a store in a small town. She sold many different items 
to people in the town. The people loved her products. 

One day, a cat came to her property. He saw the sign that indicated where 
the chicken’s store was located. He wanted to purchase bread, but the chicken’s 
store was almost empty. She had only a bag of wheat.

“You can use the wheat to make bread,” the chicken said. 

“No, I don’t want to work,” the cat said. “I just want to buy bread.” The cat 
became angry and left the store. 

Later, the little red chicken saw the cat in a crowd. 

“I will help you make the bread,” she said. 

But the cat treated her badly. He did not even communicate with her. 

He did not want to do any work. 

So the chicken decided to make the bread. She selected the exact amount of 
wheat to make fresh bread. She used a stone to pound the wheat to get it ready. 
Soon, her bread was ready. 

The cat came and saw the bread on a dish. 

“Give me some of your bread,” he said. 

“No,” said the little red chicken. “You did not help me make the bread. So 
you shall not have any to eat.” 

The cat argued with the chicken. He tried to offer a price for it. 
But the little red chicken did not want to 
sell her bread. 

“Don’t depend on others 
to do work for you,” said 
the little red chicken. 

“Then how will I get bread?” the cat asked. 

“I recommend doing some work,” said the little red 
chicken. “Use a tool to plant your own wheat. When it 
grows big, you can gather it and make your own bread. 

You need to learn to do work for what you want.”

Shipwrecked 

• Simon Yates was a lawyer. He helped many people. However, he was not a 
nice man. His policy was to help only rich people. He didn’t bother about social 
injustice. He made a lot of money, but many people didn’t like him. Even people 
on his staff didn’t like him. They wanted bad things to happen to him. In fact,

the world. The captain felt bad for Simon and said, “I will take you to foreign 
countries.” They left the next day.

pushed Simon off the boat. But he was alive. He swam toward an island. After a 
long time he got there.

thought. He had a lot of problems, but he survived. He built a house in a tree. He 
lived on a diet of fish. He made tools from wood and bones. He made a cup to 
drink rainwater.

trouble sometimes, but he always found a way to fix the problem. Life was 
simple. He liked it.

The Seven Cities of Gold 


Many years ago, a Spanish officer named Coronado heard the story of seven 
great cities. “The walls of these cities are made of gold,” his friends told him. “The 
people eat meat from golden plates and dress in nice clothes,” they said. They 
called these cities the Seven Cities of Gold. Were the cities real? Coronado never 
considered asking his friends. 

Coronado thought to himself, “The things in these cities must be worth a lot of 
money.” So he went to find the Seven Cities of Gold. He took along three hundred 
men, many horses, and extra food. They headed west. Coronado wanted to 
achieve his goal very badly. 

Coronado and his men rode for many days. Then they saw some cities. “We 
found the Seven Cities of Gold!” his men yelled, but Coronado wasn’t happy. He 
had a different opinion. “These can’t be the Seven Cities of Gold,” he said. “Look, 
they’re made of dirt!” 

Coronado was right. The cities weren’t bright and golden. They were dirty and 
brown. The people didn’t eat meat from golden plates. They ate vegetables from 
regular bowls. They wore the most basic clothes. 

Coronado regarded the cities as ugly places. 

“What happened to the cities of gold?” he thought. 

“Did someone destroy them? Was there a war? Did 
someone already come and take the gold?” 

That night, the people of the cities entertained 
Coronado and his men and served them food. 

They advised Coronado to go home. “There is 
no gold here,” they told him. Coronado was 
angry. Did his friends lie to him? 

He left the next morning. He looked back at 
the cities one more time. The sun reflected light 
on the dirt houses. Coronado thought he saw a 
bit of gold. Were his friends right after all? “No,” 
he told himself. “It’s just the 
sun.” Then he turned away 
and went home.

Katy 


I first met 8yearold Katy on a rainy afternoon. I was a nurse at a hospital. The 
clerk at the desk told me about Katy. She was there because she felt a lot of pain. 
The doctors located a problem at the base of her brain. I knew she was special, 
even before she got better. I’ll always remember Katy as a hero. 

When I entered Katy’s room, she was not in her bed. She was in a chair next to 
Tommy, a little boy. Though Katy did not feel well, she was playing with Tommy 
and his toys. It took a lot of effort for her just to sit in the chair. But she played 
with Tommy because it made him happy. 

Katy was always smiling and never appeared to be in pain. She refused to just 
lie in bed. One day I found her painting a picture. Later, she gave it to one of the 
older patients. Another day she went outside to get flowers for another sick little 
girl. Katy made everyone smile. 

The doctors hurried to fix the problem in Katy’s brain. The operation was 
successful! The doctors informed the 
hospital staff of the good news. Katy 
was fine. She soon felt excellent. She 
got better and was able to leave the 
hospital a month later. 

I have had a long career as a 
nurse. I have met many patients

A Better Reward 


Jenny delivered food for a restaurant. She read the newspaper and said, “Uh 
oh.” There was a story about a thief. He stole food, and no one had seen him. 
Even the police couldn’t catch him. Jenny was a little scared. She worked close to 
that area. 

The newspaper included a message from the police: “If anything strange 
occurs, call us. If you help us catch the thief, you’ll earn a reward.” 

Jenny talked to Jim. He managed the restaurant. “Do you know about the 
thief?” 

“Yes,” he said. “But he steals more than one person can eat. And why haven’t 
the police stopped him yet? It’s a mystery. If you see him, contact the police. 
Don’t run after him.” 

Jenny drove to a customer’s house. She left her car and opened the gate to 
the house. But then she heard a noise by her car. She yelled, “Thief!” She wasn’t 
scared. She wanted the reward! She did the opposite of what Jim told her to do. 

“Hey,” she yelled. “Get back 
here!” She set the food on the 
ground and ran to her car. 

But the thief had already left with 
the food. Jenny followed a noise 
around the corner. She was amazed. 
She saw a dog and some puppies. 
They were eating her food! They 
looked thin and scared. “The actual 
thief is just a dog. She’s feeding her 
puppies,” she said. “That’s why she 
steals so much food.” 

Jenny felt bad. She tried to comfort the dogs with another 
plate of food. Then she took them back to the store. Everyone 
there took a puppy home. Jenny called the police. She told them 
there was no real thief. 

Jenny didn’t do it to receive the reward anymore. She said, “It 
was just a dog. But there’s no charge for catching this ‘thief,’” 
she said. “My new dog is a better reward.”

The Camp 

Stacie wanted to stay at a nice hotel for vacation. But her parents sent her to a 
terrible camp instead. For breakfast, Stacie liked fresh juice and chocolate milk, 
but she got water at the camp. In the afternoon she wanted to write poems, but 
she had to swim. The camp was near an airport with loud planes. Spider webs 
hung over her bed. To her, the kids’ average behavior was very bad. No girl matched 
her personality. She hated it. 

One day, they had a class. Mental exercise sounded good to Stacie. But it was 
a course on water safety. They learned how to be safe passengers on a boat. 
Stacie didn’t ever plan to go on a boat. 

The next day, they played a game. There were a red team and a blue team. 
Stacie was on the blue team. Each team had to try to remove the other team’s 
flag from a pole. They also had to use water guns. “I’m not much of an athlete,” 
she said. But she still had to play. 

Stacie took a water gun and looked for somewhere to hide. A boy said, “Stacie, 
you advance to the middle. I will go right. Those two will go left.” 

Stacie still didn’t want to play. She walked into the forest and saw a 
red team player coming. Stacie hid behind a tree and then jumped 
out and shot the other player. “This is fun!” Stacie thought. 

Several minutes after advancing further, Stacie saw the 
red flag. A red team member was watching over it. She shot 
him with her water gun. Then she lowered the flag and ran 
back to her team. “I got it!” she yelled. The blue team won!

For the rest of the week, Stacie had fun. She even

your lack of strength.”

another town. That town had food. Because Tim was so big and strong, he almost

Joe’s Pond 

Joe made the world a better place. He got the idea to do that at school. He 
watched a video there. It was about a factory. This factory produced a lot of 
trash and put it in a river. The trash and water were a bad mix. People populated 
the area by the river and drank its water. This made them sick. Many of them 
needed medicine and made regular visits to doctors. 

But the video wasn’t all bad news. It showed ways to pick up trash and 
why it’s important to do this. It said people can make a difference to their 
environment. The video’s important features made Joe associate trash with 
hurting people. 

One day Joe walked through a park. He recognized some of the problems 
from the video. One instance of these problems was the trash in the pond. It was 
full of plastic cups. There was too much trash. Joe didn’t want it to hurt anyone. 

He told his grandfather about the park. His grandfather said, “You know, it’s 
a tradition in our family to help people. That’s why we give food to poor people. 
Maybe you can help people by cleaning the park.” 

Cleaning the park would involve hard work. Joe decided to organize a group 
to help him. He chose a wide area of the park. It had the most trash. He asked 
his family and friends to come. On Saturday, he gave everyone a sharp stick. 
They wondered why. He said, 
makes it easier.” They worket 
for six weeks. Different 
people helped each time, 
but Joe was always there. 

In that period of time, 

Joe saw a range of results. 

There was no trash in the 
water. People could swim 
in it. Joe knew that was a 
good sign. He was happy 
because he helped his 
environment.

Old Archie needed some money. He decided to sell his donkey. So he and his 
son Tom went to town. It was situated many miles away. 

Soon, they met a woman. “Where are you going?” she asked. 

“To town,” said Archie. 

“Any smart person would ride the donkey,” she said. 

“What are you implying?” Archie asked. “I’m very smart!” Archie wanted to 
look smart. So he climbed onto the donkey. Then they continued in the direction 
of the town. 

Further along the road, they met a farmer. 

“Hello,” said Archie. “We want to sell this donkey. Do you want to buy it?” 

“I don’t need a donkey,” said the farmer. “But if you want my advice, don’t ride 
it. The donkey needs to be in good physical condition.” 

“Good idea,” said Archie. “Tom, I want you to ride it. You’re lighter.” 

“Neither you nor your son should ride it. It looks very tired. You should carry 
the donkey.” suggested the farmer. 

“You’re right,” said Archie. “Come on, Tom! We’ll carry it for the final few miles!” 

The donkey was very heavy, and they couldn’t maintain a good speed. They 
didn’t arrive until late in the evening. At last, they walked into the town. But there 
they attracted the attention of some teenage boys. They laughed at Tom and

The Spider 

and the Bird 


There was once a very big spider. If a bug got into his web, he would examine 
it. However, he didn’t eat the bug right away. He asked the bug a question first. It 
was always quite a difficult puzzle. If the bug’s answer was correct, he let it go. If 
not, he ate it. 

One day, a small bird on a journey flew into the spider’s web. The spider 
couldn’t imagine eating a bird. It was so big! But his hunger was too great. He 
said to the bird, “If you cannot give me a specific answer, I will eat you.” 

The bird laughed. “I could eat you!” But the bird was actually scared. She had 
used all her energy trying to get out of the web. And a spider’s bite can be very 
effective in killing animals. 

“Please don’t eat me,” the bird said. “I would rather make a deal with you.” 

“OK,” the spider said. “If your answer is right, I will let you go. If not, you must 
give me a gift. It must be something of great value.” 

The bird said, “You can pick anything you want to eat. I will find it foryou.” The 
spider agreed. 

“Where can you take a trip to the coast, the desert, and the mountains at the 
same time?” the spider asked. 

The bird asked, “Does this place have earthquakes?” But the spider did not 
say anything. “I can see those places when I fly. Is the ‘sky’ the right answer?” 

“False!” said the spider. “The answer is Hawaii! Now you must find some bugs 
for me.” 

The spider climbed on the bird’s back. 

They flew and ate bugs together. They 


took a tour 
of the 

forest. Then 
the bird took 
the spider home. 

From that day on, 
they were friends 
And they never 
tried to eat each other 
again.

b. She is too tired from trying to get out of the web. 

c. She cannot fly because of her hunger. 

d. She would rathertake the spider on a trip. 

3. What will be the bird’s gift to the spider? 

a. A tour of the coast 

b. A specific kind of web 

c. Anything the spider wants to eat

4. What is the spider’s response to the bird’s answer? 

a. Your answer is false!

c. No deal!

The Party 

Cody’s family moved to a new house. His dad got a new job as a professor. 
Cody liked his new town, but he missed his grandparents. For his birthday, Cody 
wanted to have a party. His dad said, “Yes, we could even have a band play!” 

On the day of the party, Cody woke up and rushed to get ready. He started to 
check his list of things to do. He was so excited! But then he noticed something 
terrible. There was snow on the ground and lots of it! “Dad!” he yelled. “How can 
the band play their instruments outside?” 

Dad said, “We’ll move the stage inside.” It barely fit within the garage because 
there were some boxes and garbage there. But when they finished, they got a call 
from the band. They did not want to come in the snow storm. 

Dad said, “Let’s get someone to perform magic.” But no one would come 
because of the snow. 

Finally, Dad said, “Cody, there’s too much snow. We need to cancel the party.” 
“Yes, sir,” Cody said sadly. “It’s going to be a boring birthday,” he predicted. 
Cody wanted to share his birthday with someone. He wanted to be at his old 
home. He wanted to see his grandparents. 

But then something got his attention. He noticed a car in the driveway. His

grandparents came for his 
birthday! “Happy birthday, Cody!

a message to tell you.” 

Cody told them what 
happened. “I’m sorry,” said 
Grandpa. 

“I was sad,” Cody said. “But 
I’m not anymore. I’m so happy to 
see you.” Dad brought out Cody’s 
birthday treat. It was his favorite 
type, a sundae with whipped 
cream on top. Then Cody told 
his grandparents about the new 
town. It was his best birthday 
ever.

How the World 

Got Light 

The president of Darkland was a pig— a very bad pig. He was a pig of major 
importance. He was rich, and he had a lot of strength. But he was mean to all the 
animals in Darkland. He kept all of the world’s light in a bag. He preferred to keep 
the world cool and dark. He wanted to stop the progress of the city. The animals 
couldn’t work in the dark. He didn’t have any respect for them. “Light is too good 
for them,” he said. “Only I should have light.” 

But the animals needed light. So they decided to hold a competition. They 
wanted to find the smartest animal in Darkland. That animal had to steal light from 
the president. They advertised the competition everywhere. All the animals came. 

The animals all showed off their skills. The audience watched and then voted 
for the animal with the most knowledge. The winner was a tall bird named Raven. 
They assigned him the job of getting light. 

The next morning, Raven ate breakfast and then left his home. “How will I 
gain light from the president?” thought Raven. He needed to trick the president 
somehow. Then, Raven had an idea. Raven could make his voice sound like 
anything! 

Raven walked up to the president’s door. He made the sound of a crying baby. 
He cried very loudly. Soon, the president opened the door. 

“Be quiet!” the president yelled. Right then, Raven quickly made his move. He 
flew by the pig and found the soft bag. He took it outside. The sun was inside the 
bag! 

Raven flew high and put the sun in the sky. The president was very mad. Raven 
lim! But the other animals were very happy. At last, they had light— all 
; of Raven’s smart thinking.

Cats and Secrets 

In English, there is a common idiom “let the cat out of the bag.” It means to 
tell a secret. But where did this idiom start? 

It came from a section of England. Long ago, people there went from town to 
town to sell things like vegetables, clothes, and pigs. They had strong beliefs 
about honesty. They didn’t like lying. One day, a man went to the section’s center 
to sell things. 

“I have a baby pig for sale! It won’t cost much,” he said. He held the animal 
above his head. His style was different from honest people’s style. He was a 
master of tricking people and lying. 

A woman named Beth scanned his pig. He offered her the pig for one gold 
coin. That was a very small amount. Beth gave him the coin. He put it 
in his pocket. He walked ahead of Beth to get the pig. 

He gave her a closed bag and said, “Here’s your pig.” He then left 
very quickly. 

Beth looked at the bag’s surface. It was moving. She opened it 
to let the pig out. A cat was inside! “He tricked me! That isn’t 
proper,” she said. 

Later, the man returned to trick more people. Beth saw 
him and the memory of the cat came back. She told her 
friends. They stopped him. But no one knew what to do 
next. 

Someone said, “We need an independent and fair 
person to decide that.” They went to the judge. Beth told 
him about the cat in the bag. 

The judge asked, “Is there evidence? Can you demonstrate 
how he did it?” 

“Look in his bag,” said Beth. She opened it and let a cat 
out of the bag. They learned the man’s secret, and he went to 
jail. 

That’s how the idiom “let the cat 
out of the bag” came to 
mean to tell a secret. 





Answer the questions. 

1. What is the main idea of this story? 

a. It is about a common belief about cats. 

b. People should scan evidence carefully. 

c. Masters of lying will go to jail. 

d. It is about the origin of an idiom. 


2. What did Beth say after she was tricked? 

a. That’s not proper. 

b. That’s a very small amount. 

c. Can you demonstrate how he did it? 

d. We need an independent and fair person to help. 


3. Where did the man hold the pig? 

a. In a pocket 

b. On the surface of the bag 

c. Above his head 

d. In the section’s center 


4. Why did Beth look at the bag? 

a. The surface was moving. 

b. The man had a different style. 

c. The man was ahead of her. 

d. He offered the pig for so little money. 


5. When did the memory of the cat come back to Beth?
