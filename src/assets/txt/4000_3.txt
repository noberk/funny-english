Little Wolf and Mother Wolf 

Mother Wolf was a magnificent animal. She had all the traits of a terrific hunter. She 
was very strong and fast. She knew how to hide and how to seize prey. Mother Wolf was 
the forest’s supreme creature. Her skills were evident to all the other animals. 

Mother Wolf lived in a den beneath a tree with her cub, Little Wolf. At dawn, Little 
Wolf and Mother Wolf were eating breakfast. Little Wolf looked sad. Mother Wolf said, 
“What is wrong, my cub?” 

Little Wolf said, “I want to be big like you. You can run and leap better than anyone. 
You can howl so loudly. Being big is a necessity, and I am so small.” 

Mother Wolf said, “Don’t be dissatisfied with your size. Being small can be very 
helpful sometimes.” 

Just then, rain and hail began to fall. The tree was hit by lightning. It fell on the 
wolves’ den. Little Wolf was scared. The wolves knew that escaping the den was vital. 
Mother Wolf said, “Little Wolf, I cannot move the heavy pile of branches. But you can 
escape with ease. You can get out and find help!” 

Little Wolf crawled out of the den and called all the large animals for help. They went 
to the den and pulled away the branches. Mother Wolf came out and said, “Thankyou 
Little Wolf! You saved my life!” She softly squeezed Little Wolf and kissed her. 

Little Wolf smiled. She said, “Mother, this outcome has taught me a profound 
lesson. Even though I’m small, I’m still important.”

The Old Man with a Bump 

An old man had a large bump on his face. He went to the best physician in town. He 
gave the old man tragic news: “I can’t do anything. You’ll have to get accustomed to it.” 

One day, the old man went into the forest. Suddenly, the light became dim. It was 
going to rain. So he found a hollow tree to sit under. It leaked a little, but there was no 
other place he could wait. 

When the rain stopped, his joints felt stiff from sitting. Suddenly, he heard a tune 
coming from far away. Many fables said monsters lived in the forest. No one could 
affirm that the stories were true, though. Still, his instincts told him that there was 
something out there. He walked farther into the forest. Then he saw a fire glowing. He 
was astonished to see a clan of monsters. They were having a great feast and banging 
on drums. 

He stood behind a tree, spying on them. Then the leader asked, “Who’s the best 
dancer here?” 

“Me!” the man yelled, coming from behind the tree. He started to dance. When he 
was finished, the leader said, “I want you to dance every night. In order to make sure 
you return, I’m going to keep something you love.” 

“Please don’t take my bump,” he begged. “I can’t sacrifice it. It’s good luck!” He 
exclaimed, pointing at it for emphasis. 

The monsters agreed that they had to take his bump. After they did, the man stroked 
his face to make sure it was gone. He had tricked them! He never went back, and he 
never had to worry about his bump again.

The Circus 


Ben was unhappy. He lived on a ranch near a small town, and he didn’t have many 
friends. Then one day a messenger came to the ranch. He showed the headline in 
the town newspaper. The circus was coming to the town. It even coincided with Ben’s 
birthday! 

Ben was very excited as his father steered the car through the town. The circus 
couldn’t accommodate all the people who wanted to see the show, but Ben had a 
ticket. 

Ben peered at the activity around him. He watched people of both genders dance all 
around. They wore funny costumes, and their hair was dyed many different 
colors. Also, tame tigers with stripes on their fur did tricks. Outside, 
people could commission an informal portrait. They posed in front of a 
funny picture while an artist quickly drew them. Ben couldn’t believe it. 
He was happier than he had ever been before. 

That day, Ben knew what he wanted to do. He loved the circus to such 
an extent that he wanted to have his own circus when he grew older. 
Seeing the circus was like a dose of medicine for him. He wasn’t 
unhappy anymore. He felt special. He inquired about what he 
needed to do to have his own circus. He studied hard and 
learned about business. 

Ben worked very hard, and one day, he had his own 
circus. It was a great circus. People told him that he could be 
very rich. But he wasn’t tempted by money. He just wanted 
to make children happy. He knew the circus had changed his 
life, and he wanted to do the same thing for others.

Hans was lazy. He seldom helped his mother with anything. He didn’t cook and he 
never mowed the lawn. He didn’t even shavel He spent the daytime gambling with his 
mother’s money. One day, his mother realized that her money was gone from her purse. 
“You’re banned from my house!” she shouted. “Don’t come back until you’ve learned 
your lesson!” 

Hans went to live in the forest like an outlaw. But it was cold, and Hans couldn’t find 
food. He went to a cottage to ask for a meal. 

An Aborigine answered the door. “Can I stay here please?” Hans asked. 

“You can stay if you work,” the man replied. 

Hans liked the prospect of food and warmth, so he agreed. 

The man pointed to a field. “Take this rod and plant it over there. I am a wizard, and 
this magic rod will bring us food.” 

The field was far away. Hans knew it would be hard to walk there. So he just threw 
the rod behind the cottage and sat by the river. When daylight faded, he returned to the 
cottage and went to sleep. 

The next morning, the old man looked very fierce. “You didn’t take the 
rod to the field!” he shouted. 

“No,” confessed Hans, “it was too far!” 

“Because of you we have nothing to eat!” replied 
the man. 

Hans was terrified that the man would punish him. 

So he ran home. “Mama!” he cried, “I’m desperate to 
come back!” His mother was cautious. 

“Do you promise to work?” she asked. 

“Yes!” said Hans, “I’ll never be lazy again!”

The Bremen Town Musicians 

Larry the cow, Harry the rooster and Lester the duck lived on a widow’s farm. They 
dreamed of playing music in a parade. 

One day, the widow went to the lawn where her herd of cattle was grazing. “I’ll eat 
him tomorrow,” she said, pointing to Larry. 

Larry wanted to flee, but he didn’t have the nerve to go by himself. Then his friends 
Lester and Harry showed him a poster. 

“It’s for a parade in Bremen. We’ll go with you, and we can perform our symphony 
there,” Lester said. 

The animals put together a small bundle that held a drum, a flute and a portable 
microphone. Then they took their baggage and initiated their long journey. 

They walked down a paved lane all day. That night, they looked in the window of a 
house. They saw a group of thieves. They were eating a large dinner and telling stories 
about their greed and the people they stole from. 

Lester was an optimist. He said, “I think we can scare them away!” 

Soon, the animals came up with a plan. Harry flew inside and knocked overthe 
lamp. “What was that?” screamed a thief as the bulb broke. They could barely see now. 

Then Larry stood on two feet, and Lester flew to the top of his head. They looked very 
big. All three of the animals made scary noises. The thieves tried to hit the animals. But 
Harry flew over them and scratched them. 

“It’s a phantom!” yelled one thief. 

The thieves ran away. The animals ate and rested. The next morning, Larry said, “Why 
go to Bremen? We can stay here and make music!” And so they remained there and 
were quite happy.
