Why Monkey Has No Home 

For five years, there was a famine. The farmers asked people to bless them and 
finally, they had a good harvest. Since there was now plenty of food, the pharaoh 
decided to have a party. The party was a happy affair. For five days they had a huge 
feast. 

Monkey was very happy. Because of the famine, he was very slim. Fie wanted to eat 
a lot of food. 

When he arrived at the feast, hundreds of long tables were filled with food. There 
were nuts, bowls of cereal, and ripe fruit. Fie could also smell hot roasted meat cooking 
on the stove. 

The assembly of animals was merry. Flowever, during the feast, Monkey thought of 
a scheme to exploit the pharaoh’s kindness. Fie decided to steal some of the food and 
then eat it at home. 

All the animals were cheerful. They didn’t notice that monkey was hiding food. After 
the feast, Monkey took the food to his house and ate it. Fie repeated this routine every 
day for four days. 

But on the fifth day, the pharaoh had a surprise. He was going to give all the animals 
a home. Monkey was very excited. But when he arrived at the pharaoh’s home, he could 
not get through the door. The diameter of his waist was wider than the doorway. He was 
too fat! 

Monkey asked the pharaoh to forgive him for his theft. But the pharaoh said no. 

“Pardon?” asked the monkey. He didn’t understand why the pharaoh was being 
unkind. 

“Everybody else will have a home now, but not you. Now you know that greed gets 
you nothing,” explained the pharaoh.

Matthew Learns a Lesson 

Matthew was a sensible boy. He always kept his room tidy and had a natural literary 
aptitude. One day, he hoped to have a career in journalism. The adolescent spent much 
of his time reading and liked having privacy. But his quiet personality hindered his 
ability to make friends. 

One day, Matthew went to the pharmacy to pick up some pills for his grandmother. 
He saw some boys leaning against a pole outside. One of the boys complimented 
Matthew. “I like your jacket.” 

Another boy asked, “Do you want to go to Nate’s Restaurant?” 

“Sure!” Matthew said. 

The boys walked to the restaurant. They were going to have slices of pizza. They 
ordered their food and drank soda with straws. They ate until their bellies swelled up. 
Matthew was having so much fun. 

One of the boys said, “Let’s leave without paying.” 

Matthew didn’t want to. But he presumed his new friends wouldn’t like him if he 
didn’t. 

Suddenly, the waiter yelled, “Stop!” The two other boys ran, leaving Matthew there 
alone. 

Soon, the police arrived. “Leaving without paying foryour meal is the same as 
stealing,” said the police officer. “The restaurant wants justice. So next week you have 
to go to court and let a jury decide your punishment.” 

When he went to court, the judge asked, “Do you have anything to say, Matthew?” 

He said, “I feel sorrow for what I’ve done. Now I know that real friends won’t ask you 
to do something illegal.” 

The jury then let him have his liberty. But they 
made Matthew pick up trash as punishment. 

Much to Matthew’s surprise, he ended up meeting 
some new friends.

The Magic Cup 

Paul and John were brothers. They fought all the time because they both wanted to 
be leaders of the agency they both worked at. 

There was a superstition in their town about a magic cup. People said the cup was in 
a volcano located far away. Anyone who retrieved the cup would have their wish come 
true. John and Paul both wanted to find it. Then they could become the leader. 

They both left to find the cup. Before their trip, their mother said they should work 
together. They dismissed that idea. Even though their trips originated from the same 
house, each wanted to travel alone. 

They were both miserable during the trip. They had to navigate small boats across 
shallow rivers and climb difficult slopes. Their journey spanned many days. When they 
finally got close to the volcano, the ground began to vibrate and the volcano erupted. 
Ash filled the sky and lava covered everything. John climbed to the top of a hill to keep 
from getting burned. A few moments later, his brother went up the same hill. They were 
confined to the hill until the lava cooled down. 

They talked about the things they had seen while wandering around the country. 
They felt more sympathy and affection for each other than ever before. They decided 
that fate had brought them together. 

The next day they left to finish the 
remainder of the trip together. Everything 
seemed much easier. When they finally 
found the cup, they learned that it didn’t 
make wishes come true. It was only an 
ordinary cup. But the trip to reach the 
cup taught them to work together and 
love each other.

The Knight’s Plan 


A town was fighting for their independence from another country. Several rebels 
started a revolution. However, they were afraid of an invasion from a lot of troops. They 
didn’t have enough warriors to stop them, so they asked a knight for help. 

The knight made a plan. A tall mountain was outside the town. The road near the top 
was very narrow. Cliffs rose on both sides of it. 

“We must trick the enemy. They have to follow us up the mountain,” the knight 
explained. “On the narrow path, only a few can attack us at one time.” 

The people agreed with the knight’s plan. 

The knight put on his armor, and the warriors got their spears. When the enemy 
attacked, the knight and warriors acted as if they were afraid. They quickly 
withdrew toward the mountain. 

The enemy troops followed them up the steep path. Soon, the enemy A 

became tired. 

At the summit, the knight and his troops stopped. The enemy was close 
behind them. But now they were tired. Also, only a few could attack because 
the path was narrow. The knight and the warriors fought the enemy. 

But there were too many troops. 

The knight was afraid. If the warriors yielded the path to the 
enemy, the town would be lost. 

A storm suddenly came over the mountain. There was strong 
wind and rain. Thunder boomed. Lightning struck some trees 
near the enemy. The trees blazed. The flames scared the

The Magic Pear Tree 

It was a cool morning, and the grass was covered in mist. The market was full of 
people. A mean farmer named Jack yelled, “Pears for sale!” He sat on a bench, plotting 
how he could trick people. Then an orphan came to his cart. 

“Can you spare a pear?” she asked. 

Jack felt rage. He replied, “You don’t have any money!” 

“Please, I haven’t had supper in days.” 

“No!” shouted the farmer. 

The orphan sighed. However, a pregnant lady heard the dispute and confronted 
Jack. “Just give her a pear,” she said. Jack had no shame and said no. 

Finally, a man bought a pear for the girl. 

The girl quickly ate it, but she saved the seed. She wanted to get 

revenge. 

She told Jack, “I know a way to get hundreds of pears 
in one day. I’ll show you how.” 

He watched the girl dig a hole. She dropped the seed 
into the ground. Then she spread the dirt over it. 

“Watch closely,” she said. “In a few minutes, a stem 

will grow. It’ll turn into a tree that’s 
full of pears!” 

Jack stared at the dirt, 
but nothing happened. The 
only objects there were a few 
daisies. He looked for the girl, 

1 but she had snuck away. 

Then he looked at his 
cart in horror. It was empty!

the orphan had tricked him. 

While Jack was waiting for 
the tree to grow, the people 
had taken the pears from his 

Mlj cart. They all laughed while they were eating the 
tender fruit. The farmer felt ashamed. The incident 
taught him to be kinder.

The Old Man with a Bump 

An old man had a large bump on his face. He went to the best physician in town. He 
gave the old man tragic news: “I can’t do anything. You’ll have to get accustomed to it.” 

One day, the old man went into the forest. Suddenly, the light became dim. It was 
going to rain. So he found a hollow tree to sit under. It leaked a little, but there was no 
other place he could wait. 

When the rain stopped, his joints felt stiff from sitting. Suddenly, he heard a tune 
coming from far away. Many fables said monsters lived in the forest. No one could 
affirm that the stories were true, though. Still, his instincts told him that there was 
something out there. He walked farther into the forest. Then he saw a fire glowing. He 
was astonished to see a clan of monsters. They were having a great feast and banging 
on drums. 

He stood behind a tree, spying on them. Then the leader asked, “Who’s the best 
dancer here?” 

“Me!” the man yelled, coming from behind the tree. He started to dance. When he 
was finished, the leader said, “I want you to dance every night. In order to make sure 
you return, I’m going to keep something you love.” 

“Please don’t take my bump,” he begged. “I can’t sacrifice it. It’s good luck!” He 
exclaimed, pointing at it for emphasis. 

The monsters agreed that they had to take his bump. After they did, the man stroked 
his face to make sure it was gone. He had tricked them! He never went back, and he 
never had to worry about his bump again.

The Circus 


Ben was unhappy. He lived on a ranch near a small town, and he didn’t have many 
friends. Then one day a messenger came to the ranch. He showed the headline in 
the town newspaper. The circus was coming to the town. It even coincided with Ben’s 
birthday! 

Ben was very excited as his father steered the car through the town. The circus 
couldn’t accommodate all the people who wanted to see the show, but Ben had a 
ticket. 

Ben peered at the activity around him. He watched people of both genders dance all 
around. They wore funny costumes, and their hair was dyed many different 
colors. Also, tame tigers with stripes on their fur did tricks. Outside, 
people could commission an informal portrait. They posed in front of a 
funny picture while an artist quickly drew them. Ben couldn’t believe it. 
He was happier than he had ever been before. 

That day, Ben knew what he wanted to do. He loved the circus to such 
an extent that he wanted to have his own circus when he grew older. 
Seeing the circus was like a dose of medicine for him. He wasn’t 
unhappy anymore. He felt special. He inquired about what he 
needed to do to have his own circus. He studied hard and 
learned about business. 

Ben worked very hard, and one day, he had his own 
circus. It was a great circus. People told him that he could be 
very rich. But he wasn’t tempted by money. He just wanted 
to make children happy. He knew the circus had changed his 
life, and he wanted to do the same thing for others.

The Bremen Town Musicians 

Larry the cow, Harry the rooster and Lester the duck lived on a widow’s farm. They 
dreamed of playing music in a parade. 

One day, the widow went to the lawn where her herd of cattle was grazing. “I’ll eat 
him tomorrow,” she said, pointing to Larry. 

Larry wanted to flee, but he didn’t have the nerve to go by himself. Then his friends 
Lester and Harry showed him a poster. 

“It’s for a parade in Bremen. We’ll go with you, and we can perform our symphony 
there,” Lester said. 

The animals put together a small bundle that held a drum, a flute and a portable 
microphone. Then they took their baggage and initiated their long journey. 

They walked down a paved lane all day. That night, they looked in the window of a 
house. They saw a group of thieves. They were eating a large dinner and telling stories 
about their greed and the people they stole from. 

Lester was an optimist. He said, “I think we can scare them away!” 

Soon, the animals came up with a plan. Harry flew inside and knocked overthe 
lamp. “What was that?” screamed a thief as the bulb broke. They could barely see now. 

Then Larry stood on two feet, and Lester flew to the top of his head. They looked very 
big. All three of the animals made scary noises. The thieves tried to hit the animals. But 
Harry flew over them and scratched them. 

“It’s a phantom!” yelled one thief. 

The thieves ran away. The animals ate and rested. The next morning, Larry said, “Why 
go to Bremen? We can stay here and make music!” And so they remained there and 
were quite happy.
