Sue left her dormitory early that morning. She had even washed her uniform 
the night before. She wanted to look nice for the day.

In fact, Sue didn’t sleep much. She composed a paper and found the perfect 
thesis about the importance of greenhouses. She also studied for her physics 
test. Sue was already tired. 

During the test, she calculated her answers. Soon, she felt sick. Her face got 
hot, and her vision began to blur. She was blind for a moment. The teacher saw

go. Sue still had a portion of the test to finish. 

After that, Sue went to the nurse. After seeing the secretary, she waited.

The Lucky Knife 

I’ve devoted my life to studying past generations. Last year, I had a unique 
chance to work with my uncle. Our job was to find old treasures for a school’s 
history foundation. He also hired a crew of students. They signed a contract to 
work with him. He was the boss. The place was strange, though. I dined on many 
things that I had never tasted before. They had an unusual flavor. 

We had been there about a month and hadn’t found anything. One day, I 
began to dig in the soil. The ground’s layers got wetter. Soon I was digging in 
the mud. My shovel began to get very heavy. It felt like it had doubled in weight 
because the ground had absorbed a lot of water. 

Finally, I saw something in the mud. It was an old knife! The handle felt 
smooth in my hand. I elevated it so I could see it better. There was writing on it. 

“It says it will bring good luck,” my uncle said with a smile. “Why don’t you 
keep it?” 

I put it in my tent. The next day, we found many more things. There were pots, 
jewelry and weapons. My uncle donated all of the things to a special committee. 
Many newspapers wrote stories about it. It seemed the knife really did bring 
good luck!

Sam’s mother cooked at the royal palace. One day, he went to work with her. 
She emphasized that he should stay in the kitchen. But Sam was bored. Thus, 
he decided to look around.

spoke. “Come with me.” 

He needed to be rational. But he couldn’t deny that he wanted to go. So he

“Trade places with me.” The prince said.

Henry Ford’s Famous Car 


My name is Henry Ford, and I invented a car called the Model T. I used to 
watch carriages on the streets. They fascinated me. Then I got a job as a junior 
mechanic. My father criticized me. He wanted me to run the farm. But I did not

The Priest 


A young priest was always sad. He was good at his 
profession, but he still had no joy. He visited a group of 
wise monks. 

When he got to the monks’ house, they greeted 
him and let him in. The monks asked the priest, 

“What is the matter?” The priest said, “I should 
be happy, but I am not. I don’t know 
what to do.” The wise monks paused 
for a minute. Then one said, “We 
are convinced of your faith. You are 
a very good priest. But to find joy, 
you have to do more. Above all, 
investigate the elements of your 
life that you love.” The priest 
thought that this answer was 
odd, but he was curious. 

The next day, the priest thought 
about his abilities. He got a few 
ideas, and he did not want to delay 
any longer. He liked to draw, so he made 
some cartoons. He also liked to write, so 
he started a diary. He was interested in 
agriculture, so he planted some grains. 

He made jam from berries. He made his 
own labels to put on the jars of jam. He 
painted his ceiling. The priest learned 
something. It is not too hard to be 
happy after all. All one has to do is 
find things they like doing, and do 
them!

Mrs. May 

and the Green Girl 

One morning, people from a small town found a little girl by a stream. She 
seemed to be wearing a green costume. As the people got closer, they saw that 
the girl’s skin was green! 

“Oh my!” The people exclaimed. “What if her motive for coming to our town 
is bad? What if she has a strange origin?” 

An old woman kindly went to her. “Look how scared she is. Please,” she 
begged. “Do not reject her. I will adopt her.” 

There was silence until the judge spoke. “I don’t know,” he said in a worried 
tone. “But we cannot forbid you. I indeed hope you’re not being a fool.” 

Mrs. May extended her hand to the girl. “Come 
with me. I won’t hurt you.” 

The girl spoke a language Mrs. May didn’t 
know. But she was able to interpret what 
the girl was trying to say. Sometimes the girl 
drew pictures to illustrate what she meant. 

The green girl was from a place far 
beyond the sun. There, people lived in 
nests built in trees. They only ate green 
leaves, which made their skin green. 

“Well, you can’t just eat leaves,” Mrs. 

May said. She fed the green 
girl home-cooked meals, 
and soon the girl wasn’t 
green anymore. The 
people had a huge 
reception to welcome 
her as a citizen of the 
town.

Albert Einstein 


My name is Albert Einstein. Many people know about the great things I’ve 
accomplished. But I had many barriers before I became famous. 

I was born in Germany. When I was in elementary school, I already knew 
about math and statistics. When I was a boy, I pretended to be a great scientist. 
I loved school, but my life at home was hard. My father lost his job, so my family 
lived in poverty. We could not pay the rent in Germany. We became immigrants 
and went to Italy. I finished high school and went to college in Switzerland. 

After college, I began writing about science. I did not reach success in an 
instant, though. At first, other scientists did not approve of my work. They 
thought I was a failure. Rising to the rank of an admired scientist was a gradual 
process. Soon, people started to notice that I was right. At last, I began to get 
some recognition. 

I showed how to find the approximate size of very big things, like stars. I also 
detected and explained the movement of very small things, like atoms. And 

for fun, I made a machine that could 
refrigerate food by inserting 
heat. I never retired. It 
was my duty to keep 
working. I overcame 
many hard times, 
and I will be 
remembered 
for my 
important 
works.

From the Earth 

to the Stars 

Jeremy was from a family of miners. Like them, he worked underground 
during the day. His job was to gather raw minerals and jewels. Each night after 
work, he lay awake in an open field. With his telescope, he looked at the stars. 
He was amazed by the scale of space. He wished someday he might travel there. 

One day there was an accident in the mine. Water poured into the mine. 
Everything was dark. Jeremy stretched out and grabbed a piece of wood. It kept 
him from sinking. Jeremy felt a presence nearby. 

“I am an angel,” said a voice. 

“What?” Jeremy exclaimed. 

“You must never come underground again. Have the courage to make your 
wishes come true.” 

For a long time he floated in silence. Then he heard other voices. The other 
miners were coming to rescue him. 

The next day Jeremy skipped work. He decided to become an astronaut. 

For the next two years, he studied hard. One day, he was given permission to 
participate in a mission to space. His wish had been granted. 

His spaceship left the ground. It went higher until there was no 
more gravity. He saw satellites floating next to the 
ship. 

Then Jeremy saw a beautiful angel outside 
his spaceship. It smiled at Jeremy. For some 
minutes, Jeremy could not speak. Finally, he 
said, “Thank you.”

Once there was a farm. Many animals lived there. One day, they had a contest 
in the yard. They were going to race from the barn to the farmer’s garage. The 
barn and the garage were far apart. It would be a long race. The winner qualified 
to win a bag full of apples as an award. 

But the race did not start well. The cart with all the apples was not stable, 
and the animals had to repair it. Then the pup knocked overthe apples. The pig 
yelled, “We are going to slip! We must clean up this mess.” The pup felt bad, 
and she began to cry. The dog gave her a tissue to wipe her tears. 

Then the race resumed. But the duck tried to rob them and take all the 
apples. The cat said, “I will have you arrested!” The duck said, “You can’t convict 
me! You can’t prove I took it.” The race stopped yet again. 

The animals tried to race one more time. Then they heard an alarm coming 
from the barn. There was a fire! They got buckets of water to put out the fire. A 
journalist came to write a story about the festival and the race. The horse told

The Clever Thief 


A new king inherited a lot of gold. He loved his gold very much. He even 
wanted to keep it after he died. Therefore, he had a large tomb built for himself 
and his riches. 

However, the tomb’s builder had a plan. Most of the stones were solid, but 
he put one special stone on the roof. It was made of a lighter substance. 

When the tomb was done, the king moved in his stock of gold. One night, 
the builder went to the tomb. His excitement mounted. Because all the stones 
looked alike, he had left a distinct mark on the artificial block. The mark helped 
him distinguish the difference in the architecture. 

The builder lifted the stone. Using a chain, he climbed into the tomb. He filled 
his pockets with gold. 

The builder followed this manner night after night. Soon, the king noticed a 
shortage in his gold. This annoyed the king. 

At last he hired a guard to hide inside the 
tomb. When the builder entered the tomb, 
the guard wounded him. He climbed a pole 
to the roof. The builder left drops of blood 
in the dust. The guard followed them and 
caught him.

tube. He was hurt. 

Steve came to visit him in the hospital. James said, “It will be tough for me to 
stay in bed. But I can hardly bend my legs.” 

“Then let’s watch a movie.” Steve said. It made them laugh together. Steve 
said, “I have to leave, but here’s some fiction to read.” 

James started to recall fun parts of life. He marveled at small things, like 
food. He was too busy to notice them before. “Steve,” he said, “you get more 

nutrients when you chew slowly. But I think it makes 
food taste better, too!” 

Weeks later, James said, “Steve, I haven’t spent 
enough time with you. I regret this. Even my soul feels 
better when you visit. But I have spent sufficient time 
here. We should go home.” 

Outside, there was a warm breeze. James watched a

The Two Captains 





Once there were two ships. Both ships carried cotton. The captains were very 
different. Thomas was strict. He made his crew engage in difficult tasks. “Make 
sure the ship’s deck is firm and that nothing falls! Put more fuel in the tank!” he 
said. His ship was very plain, but he never had a problem with it. 

The second captain, William, was not serious. He had a grand ship, and he 
loved having fun. His crew amused him by singing and dancing. But his crew 
never fixed anything on the ship. They just wanted to surf. 

One day, Thomas saw a hurricane ahead. He knew that his ship needed to 
turn around. But he was sure William did not see the storm. He adjusted the 
dials on the radio and called his friend. Thomas said, “You’ll hit the reef. It’s 
made completely of coral. Turn around to ensure that you do not crash.” 

William said, “We will go under the deck and shut the door. We will dance 
and sing until we are past the danger zone.” 

When William’s ship got to the hurricane, the wind blew it into the reef. The 
ship crashed, and water flowed below the deck. William’s 
crew accused him of being 
a bad captain. The 
loss of the ship 
taught William 
a lesson. There 
are times to 
have fun, but 
there are also 
times to be serious.

Osiris and the Nile 



Long ago, Osiris was the king of Egypt, and Isis was the queen. They ruled 
the fertile land by the Nile River. They had great intelligence, and they shared 
their abstract ideas with everyone. Osiris taught the Egyptians how to make 
wheels and furniture. Isis taught them how to make things from clay and cloth. 
The people thought they deserved a gift. So they built Osiris and Isis a pyramid. 
Everyone loved Osiris except his brother, Set. Set wanted to be king. 

Osiris made his annual trip around Egypt and led religious events. The 
villages gave him beautiful shells and colorful feathers as gifts. 

When Osiris returned, Set brought a beautiful wooden box from behind a 
curtain. 

“If someone fits inside this box, I will give it to him or her,” Set said. 

Osiris got in it. It was an ideal fit! 

Suddenly, Set closed the box and threw it into the river. “Now I will be king!” 
Set said. 

The box washed up on a foreign shore after a flood. Isis brought his body 
home and obtained a grave for him in 
Egypt. The Egyptian gods thought Isis 
had done something very romantic.

The Taxi Driver 

Peter’s job was driving a taxi downtown. He made a small salary. But he 
liked his job because it wasn’t dull. Every day, he saw new things that appealed 
to him. Peter was practical about the future. “Maybe I can get a scholarship to 
college,” he thought. “I could learn mathematical formulas and get a job at a 
bank. I could help clients invest their money.” 

Peter stopped to pick up a passenger. “Where to?” he asked. 

“Go to the Fourth Street Bank. And don’t talk to me. I’ve had a rough day,” 
the man said. Peterwas angry, but he had a peaceful philosophy. When they 
stopped, the man’s fare came to $10.25. He put his hands in his pockets. “I 
can’t find my wallet!” he said. “I can’t pay the fare!” 

Peter said, “Maybe I’ll give you a temporary loan. You can borrow ten dollars 
and a quarter from me.” 

The man was embarrassed, saying, “I was mean to you, but now I want to 
help you. I founded this bank. I want to give you one thousand dollars.” 

That much money was like a treasure to Peter. The man urged him to take the 
money, but he didn’t. 

“You’re an honest person,” the man said. “I 
assumed you would take it. I want you to work for 
me.” 

The next day, Peter started his job at the bank. 
He was happy to be done with his former job.
