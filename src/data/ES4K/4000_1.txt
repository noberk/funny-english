Archie and His Donkey 





Old Archie needed some money. He decided to sell his donkey. So he and his 
son Tom went to town. It was situated many miles away. 

Soon, they met a woman. “Where are you going?” she asked. 

“To town,” said Archie. 

“Any smart person would ride the donkey,” she said. 

“What are you implying?” Archie asked. “I’m very smart!” Archie wanted to 
look smart. So he climbed onto the donkey. Then they continued in the direction 
of the town. 

Further along the road, they met a farmer. 

“Hello,” said Archie. “We want to sell this donkey. Do you want to buy it?” 

“I don’t need a donkey,” said the farmer. “But if you want my advice, don’t ride 
it. The donkey needs to be in good physical condition.” 

“Good idea,” said Archie. “Tom, I want you to ride it. You’re lighter.” 

“Neither you nor your son should ride it. It looks very tired. You should carry 
the donkey.” suggested the farmer. 

“You’re right,” said Archie. “Come on, Tom! We’ll carry it for the final few miles!” 

The donkey was very heavy, and they couldn’t maintain a good speed. They 
didn’t arrive until late in the evening. At last, they walked into the town. But there 
they attracted the attention of some teenage boys. They laughed at Tom and 
Archie. They started to throw stones at them. The donkey reacted by kicking. Tom 
and Archie dropped the donkey. It fell on the ground and then ran 
away. Archie lost his donkey. He went home with no money.

The Spider 

and the Bird 


There was once a very big spider. If a bug got into his web, he would examine 
it. However, he didn’t eat the bug right away. He asked the bug a question first. It 
was always quite a difficult puzzle. If the bug’s answer was correct, he let it go. If 
not, he ate it. 

One day, a small bird on a journey flew into the spider’s web. The spider 
couldn’t imagine eating a bird. It was so big! But his hunger was too great. He 
said to the bird, “If you cannot give me a specific answer, I will eat you.” 

The bird laughed. “I could eat you!” But the bird was actually scared. She had 
used all her energy trying to get out of the web. And a spider’s bite can be very 
effective in killing animals. 

“Please don’t eat me,” the bird said. “I would rather make a deal with you.” 

“OK,” the spider said. “If your answer is right, I will let you go. If not, you must 
give me a gift. It must be something of great value.” 

The bird said, “You can pick anything you want to eat. I will find it foryou.” The 
spider agreed. 

“Where can you take a trip to the coast, the desert, and the mountains at the 
same time?” the spider asked. 

The bird asked, “Does this place have earthquakes?” But the spider did not 
say anything. “I can see those places when I fly. Is the ‘sky’ the right answer?” 

“False!” said the spider. “The answer is Hawaii! Now you must find some bugs 
for me.” 

The spider climbed on the bird’s back. 

They flew and ate bugs together. They 


took a tour 
of the 

forest. Then 
the bird took 
the spider home. 

From that day on, 
they were friends 
And they never 
tried to eat each other 
again.

The Party 

Cody’s family moved to a new house. His dad got a new job as a professor. 
Cody liked his new town, but he missed his grandparents. For his birthday, Cody 
wanted to have a party. His dad said, “Yes, we could even have a band play!” 

On the day of the party, Cody woke up and rushed to get ready. He started to 
check his list of things to do. He was so excited! But then he noticed something 
terrible. There was snow on the ground and lots of it! “Dad!” he yelled. “How can 
the band play their instruments outside?” 

Dad said, “We’ll move the stage inside.” It barely fit within the garage because 
there were some boxes and garbage there. But when they finished, they got a call 
from the band. They did not want to come in the snow storm. 

Dad said, “Let’s get someone to perform magic.” But no one would come 
because of the snow. 

Finally, Dad said, “Cody, there’s too much snow. We need to cancel the party.” 
“Yes, sir,” Cody said sadly. “It’s going to be a boring birthday,” he predicted.

Cody told them what 
happened. “I’m sorry,” said 
Grandpa. 

“I was sad,” Cody said. “But 
I’m not anymore. I’m so happy to 
see you.” Dad brought out Cody’s 
birthday treat. It was his favorite 
type, a sundae with whipped

How the World 

Got Light 

The president of Darkland was a pig— a very bad pig. He was a pig of major 
importance. He was rich, and he had a lot of strength. But he was mean to all the 
animals in Darkland. He kept all of the world’s light in a bag. He preferred to keep 
the world cool and dark. He wanted to stop the progress of the city. The animals 
couldn’t work in the dark. He didn’t have any respect for them. “Light is too good 
for them,” he said. “Only I should have light.” 

But the animals needed light. So they decided to hold a competition. They 
wanted to find the smartest animal in Darkland. That animal had to steal light from 
the president. They advertised the competition everywhere. All the animals came. 

The animals all showed off their skills. The audience watched and then voted 
for the animal with the most knowledge. The winner was a tall bird named Raven. 
They assigned him the job of getting light. 

The next morning, Raven ate breakfast and then left his home. “How will I 
gain light from the president?” thought Raven. He needed to trick the president 
somehow. Then, Raven had an idea. Raven could make his voice sound like 
anything! 

Raven walked up to the president’s door. He made the sound of a crying baby. 
He cried very loudly. Soon, the president opened the door. 

“Be quiet!” the president yelled. Right then, Raven quickly made his move. He 
flew by the pig and found the soft bag. He took it outside. The sun was inside the 
bag! 

Raven flew high and put the sun in the sky. The president was very mad. Raven 
lim! But the other animals were very happy. At last, they had light— all 
; of Raven’s smart thinking.

Cats and Secrets 

In English, there is a common idiom “let the cat out of the bag.” It means to 
tell a secret. But where did this idiom start? 

It came from a section of England. Long ago, people there went from town to 
town to sell things like vegetables, clothes, and pigs. They had strong beliefs 
about honesty. They didn’t like lying. One day, a man went to the section’s center 
to sell things. 

“I have a baby pig for sale! It won’t cost much,” he said. He held the animal 
above his head. His style was different from honest people’s style. He was a 
master of tricking people and lying. 

A woman named Beth scanned his pig. He offered her the pig for one gold 
coin. That was a very small amount. Beth gave him the coin. He put it 
in his pocket. He walked ahead of Beth to get the pig. 

He gave her a closed bag and said, “Here’s your pig.” He then left 
very quickly. 

Beth looked at the bag’s surface. It was moving. She opened it 
to let the pig out. A cat was inside! “He tricked me! That isn’t 
proper,” she said. 

Later, the man returned to trick more people. Beth saw 
him and the memory of the cat came back. She told her 
friends. They stopped him. But no one knew what to do 
next. 

Someone said, “We need an independent and fair 
person to decide that.” They went to the judge. Beth told 
him about the cat in the bag. 

The judge asked, “Is there evidence? Can you demonstrate 
how he did it?” 

“Look in his bag,” said Beth. She opened it and let a cat 
out of the bag. They learned the man’s secret, and he went to 
jail. 

That’s how the idiom “let the cat 
out of the bag” came to 
mean to tell a secret.

2. What did Beth say after she was tricked? 

a. That’s not proper. 

b. That’s a very small amount. 

c. Can you demonstrate how he did it? 

d. We need an independent and fair person to help. 


3. Where did the man hold the pig? 

a. In a pocket 

b. On the surface of the bag 

c. Above his head 

d. In the section’s center 


4. Why did Beth look at the bag? 

a. The surface was moving. 

b. The man had a different style. 

c. The man was ahead of her. 

d. He offered the pig for so little money. 


5. When did the memory of the cat come back to Beth?
