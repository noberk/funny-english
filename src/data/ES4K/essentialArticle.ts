      "The Twelve Months",
      `An awful woman lived with her daughter and stepdaughter in her household. 
      She possessed feelings of hate for her stepdaughter, Anna. Anna worked 
      while her stepsister did nothing. On a cold January night, Anna’s stepmother 
      remarked, “Your stepsister desires flowers. Go and find some.” 
      
      Anna wasn’t anxious to walk through the chilled landscape. The cold air made 
      her lungs burn. She walked at a slow pace because of the snow. Soon she saw a 
      group of people. It consisted of twelve men. Anna told them about the flowers. 
      
      One ofthe man said they were the twelve months and that they would help 
      Anna. January walked to her and made a motion with his hand. The days of 
      the month passed rapidly until it was February’s turn. February also made the 
      month speed up. Then March made the sun shine and flowers grew in the held. 
      
      Anna loaded her basket with so many flowers that she could hardly lift it. 
      
      Then she gave a quick but polite “thankyou” to the twelve men and returned 
      home. She was very eager to show her stepmother all the flowers. Back at the 
      house, she spilled the flowers onto the table. Then she told her stepmother 
      
      about the twelve men. Anna’s stepmother and stepsister went 
      to seek the twelve months. Their intent was to ask for 
      gifts. They looked and looked. They became very lost 
      and never found their way home. Anna lived happily 
      by herself. `

      "The Dragon",
      `
      An evil dragon lived in a castle in the remote southern mountains. 

One day the monster landed in a town. The dragon commanded the people, 
“Give me food now, or I will eat you!” The dragon lifted its wings so that its lungs 
could be completely filled with hot steam, and breathed it upon the people. A 
man turned into a stone statue! 

The people submitted and brought food. The dragon ate all of it and left. 

The people sent a boy to ask for help from a wise old man. He resided in a 

temple. 

The boy told the old man about the dragon. Then, the old man counseled the 
boy. “A meteor will fall in the northern sky. It will make a huge explosion. Find 
the meteor and bring it to me. I will use it to make a sword for you.” 

The boy did as the old man said. Soon, the sword was ready. 

“Use this to kill the dragon. But be careful. You must cover yourself with weeds 
that smell bad. That will ensure that he does not 
smell you,” the man said. 

The boy traveled for many days to find the 
castle. He went to the upper level and opened 
a door. He could see the dragon’s tail. It was 
sleeping, so the boy killed it. Then, he took the 
dragon’s gold and jewelry and returned to his

    "The Battle of Thermopylae ",

   ` This is a true story. It happened long ago in Greece 
    
    “We must fight,” the Spartan* chief told his small army of brave men. They 
    were at a great disadvantage. There were only three hundred of them. The Persian 
    military had hundreds of thousands of men. 
    
    They were going to lose unless they could secure a small entrance. The enemy 
    couldn’t move through it easily. They intended to stop the enemy here. The chief 
    and his men got ready for the battle. 
    
    Soon, long lines of the enemy’s army twisted around the hills. The chief met the 
    enemy with laughter. He knew that his men’s weapons and skills were better. The 
    Spartans trusted their leader and obeyed him. 
    
    First, the enemy soldiers shot arrows from their bows. The chief told his men 
    to lift their shields*. The arrows stuck into the shields but did not hurt any of the 
    men. 
    
    Then the enemy’s soldiers attacked the Spartans with long spears. The chief 
    surprised them. His troops rolled logs down on the enemy. 
    
    They fought for three days. Though they hardly slept at all, 
    the chief and his men remained steady. 
    
    But the enemy found a way to beat the Spartans. The 
    chief and all of his men were killed. Even though they 
    lost, the Battle ofThermopylae is one of the most famous 
    battles in history. `

`The Deer and His Image `,


`A deer told himself every day, “I am the most handsome deer in the forest. 

My large chest is a symbol of my power. And my beautiful horns impress other 
animals.” 

But he did not like his legs and hooves*. “My legs are narrow, and my hooves 
are ugly. They do not satisfy me.” 

One day, the deer saw a big dog. The deer made some noise and disturbed 
the dog. The dog woke up and chased him. The deer felt terror. He screamed. He 
did not want to be a victim, so he ran into the forest. His strong legs helped him 
run fast. His pale brown hooves were hard, so they were not sensitive to rough 
rocks. However, his horns got caught in branches, slowing him down. His large 
chest could not fit between thick trees. 

The deer estimated that he ran for an hour. He felt like he was running a 
marathon. In the end, the deer escaped the threat of the dog. He sat in the 
shade of a tree. “That was almost a disaster! I almost did not escape because 
of my chest and horns. My legs and hooves saved me.” As a consequence, the 
deer learned to honor his fast legs and have confidence in his strong hooves. 
“Pretty things only supplement important things,” he thought. `

   ` May 29, 1953 `,

  `  Today is the most important day of my life. I finally climbed Mt. Everest, the 
    tallest mountain in the world. 
    
    The top of the mountain was amazing. It felt like we were close to heaven. The 
    snow was so thick that my boots sank. The air was silent. I looked at the beauty 
    that surrounded me. Maybe my story will be a legend someday. 
    
    I want people to remember this forever. I was the senior explorer in my group, 
    and I knew we needed proof of our climb. I took many pictures with my camera. I’ll 
    put them in a frame and hang them. 
    
    On the mountain, the air was very cold. I wrapped my coat around my body. 
    
    I looked over the side of the mountaintop. From that angle, I saw the border of 
    the clouds touch the rocks below. The snow was thick. It looked pure. There was 
    no sign of modern life. Thousands of years ago, my ancestors saw the world this 
    way. 
    
    After fifteen minutes, I knew it was time to proceed down the mountain. The 
    whole team congratulated us. My superior, John Hunt, praised us all. I sent 
    messages to my relatives to tell them that I was safe. But it was hard to leave 
    the mountain so quickly. I wanted to enjoy the incredible sight even longer. `

    `A Beautiful Bird `,

    `Dr. Norton’s occupation was a scholar of biology. He learned about all 
    animals on a daily basis. One day he met a sailor from a colony overseas. The 
    man told Dr. Norton about a talking bird! The bird fascinated Dr. Norton, so 
    he told his colleagues about it. They debated with him: no one thought a bird 
    could talk. He tried to persuade them, but they laughed at him. Nevertheless, 
    Dr. Norton believed the bird was real. His new mission was to find it. He wanted 
    factual proof. 
    
    The next day he departed for the colony. The sailor he had met told him to 
    look for a man named Jai, who would be able to help him in his search. After a 
    month of sailing, Dr. Norton finally reached the colony where he met jai. 
    
    “I can take you to where it lives. It lives by the volcano,” Jai said. 
    
    They left the next day. A week later, they arrived at the volcano. Every day 
    they walked around and looked for the bird, but they couldn’t find it. After one 
    month, Dr. Norton could not find the bird, and this depressed him. He decided 
    to go home. On the route back, he walked past some old ruins. He heard 
    someone say, “Hello.” 
    
    “Who are you?” he asked. Dr. Norton looked up and saw a bird!

    Ricky. She needed a definite way to succeed. She told her family about the race, 
    “I have concluded that I have to resort to something bad. I will cheat.” She 
    dictated her instructions to them. 
    
    At the race, they all wore white feathers. They looked exactly the same! Then, 
    her family members hid in shadows on the path. 
    
    The race began. Tera was soon far behind. However, Tera’s brother hid behind 
    a bush in the valley below. When Ricky got close, Tera’s brother began to run. He 
    looked just like Tera! Ricky ran as fast as he could along the path. But, to him, it 
    seemed like Tera was always ahead. Ricky had used a considerable amount of

   ` The Tale of Bartelby O’Boyle `,

    `Long ago, there was a clever man by the name of Bartelby O’Boyle. As a boy, 
    he was kept as a slave by the royal family. He saw other children play, but he 
    always had to work. This frustrated him very much. But he was not stupid, and 
    he wanted to change things. 
    
    Then one day there was a struggle for authority in the kingdom. There was a 
    division of the people, and one group fought against another group to see which 
    would govern the kingdom. There was disorder in the kingdom. Bartelby ran 
    
    away. He saw much fighting and destruction. Many 
    people had nothing to eat; Bartelby decided to aid 
    them. He would help them get food. But how? 
    
    Bartelby went to the capital to find 
    an answer. There, he met a man named 
    Gilliam. A group of men attempted to hurt 
    Gilliam. Bartelby defended him. Then, 
    he gave Gilliam some food to relieve 
    his hunger. After that, the two became 
    friends. They took food from the rich 
    and gave it to the poor. 
    
    Soon, other people cooperated 
    with them. Working together 
    enabled them to take more food. 
    But they only took food from 
    people who had plenty, and they 
    always gave it to those who had 
    none. Because of this, Bartleby 
    gained a reputation across

  `  Blackbeard `,


  `  A long time ago, I had my first job. It didn’t give me much of an income. It was 
    on a giant pirate ship. On my first night, there was a thick fog over the water. A 
    lamp on the ship revealed an enormous man. He had a sword in his belt. His 
    name was Blackbeard, and he was one of the most violent pirates ever. 
    
    One day, Blackbeard did an extraordinary thing. He attacked several ships 
    near a town. He took some of the town’s citizens. Then he declared, “You give 
    me medicine!” Blackbeard wanted the medicine for some of the sick pirates on 
    his ship. 
    
    The people had a bad impression of him. They were mad, and they resisted. 
    But they were trapped. They wanted to get rid of him. So the town’s council 
    decided to give him the medicine. 
    
    After this, there was a reward for catching 
    Blackbeard. If Blackbeard was caught, he would 
    have a trial. He didn’t want to go to jail, so he 
    quit being a pirate. 
    
    Blackbeard became a fisherman. But 
    he ought to have stayed on land. The 
    Royal Navy was still looking for him. They 
    attacked him while he was fishing on his 
    boat. Blackbeard fought against many 
    men. Finally, he was killed. He didn’t 
    even get a funeral. But people still tell

   ` The Mean Chef `,

    I can call them to lend their help. I can escape an entire army if I have to!” 
    
    Then, the fox asked, “What are your potential plans?” The cat said, “I have

    We had been there about a month and hadn’t found anything. One day, I 
    began to dig in the soil. The ground’s layers got wetter. Soon I was digging in 
    the mud. My shovel began to get very heavy. It felt like it had doubled in weight 
    because the ground had absorbed a lot of water. 
    
    Finally, I saw something in the mud. It was an old knife! The handle felt 
    smooth in my hand. I elevated it so I could see it better. There was writing on it. 
    
    “It says it will bring good luck,” my uncle said with a smile. “Why don’t you 
    keep it?” 
    
    I put it in my tent. The next day, we found many more things. There were pots,

    mechanic. My father criticized me. He wanted me to run the farm. But I did not 
    shift my plans. 
    
    Then I worked for the Detroit Auto Company. But I wanted to make cars using 
    less labor. That way, there would be fewer expenses. I started the Ford Motor 
    Company in 1903. At first, the company did not do well. But many people were 
    betting on my success. I also had a sincere aim to make a car that anybody 
    could buy. 
    
    Then, in 1908, 1 introduced the Model-T in a formal ceremony. It confirmed 
    that I was right: it was possible to build a car my way! 
    
    The Model T differed from other vehicles. Workers could attach different parts 
    for cars or trucks. This saved time. One Model T could be put together in 93 
    minutes. All of them had the same classic design. They were all the same size 
    and height. The prime reason for doing this was to save money. 
    
    Over 19 years, I sold over 15 million 
    Model Ts. This sent a signal

    `The Priest `,


   ` A young priest was always sad. He was good at his 
    profession, but he still had no joy. He visited a group of 
    wise monks. 
    
    When he got to the monks’ house, they greeted 
    him and let him in. The monks asked the priest, 
    
    “What is the matter?” The priest said, “I should 
    be happy, but I am not. I don’t know 
    what to do.” The wise monks paused 
    for a minute. Then one said, “We 
    are convinced of your faith. You are 
    a very good priest. But to find joy, 
    you have to do more. Above all, 
    investigate the elements of your 
    life that you love.” The priest 
    thought that this answer was 
    odd, but he was curious. 
    
    The next day, the priest thought 
    about his abilities. He got a few 
    ideas, and he did not want to delay 
    any longer. He liked to draw, so he made 
    some cartoons. He also liked to write, so 
    he started a diary. He was interested in 
    agriculture, so he planted some grains. 
    
    He made jam from berries. He made his 
    own labels to put on the jars of jam. He 
    painted his ceiling. The priest learned

    `Mrs. May and the Green Girl `,

    seemed to be wearing a green costume. As the people got closer, they saw that 
    the girl’s skin was green! 
    
    “Oh my!” The people exclaimed. “What if her motive for coming to our town 
    is bad? What if she has a strange origin?” 
    
    An old woman kindly went to her. “Look how scared she is. Please,” she

    the girl was trying to say. Sometimes the girl 
    drew pictures to illustrate what she meant. 
    
    The green girl was from a place far 
    beyond the sun. There, people lived in 
    nests built in trees. They only ate green 
    leaves, which made their skin green.

    girl home-cooked meals,

    `My name is Albert Einstein. Many people know about the great things I’ve 
    accomplished. But I had many barriers before I became famous. 
    
    I was born in Germany. When I was in elementary school, I already knew 
    about math and statistics. When I was a boy, I pretended to be a great scientist. 
    I loved school, but my life at home was hard. My father lost his job, so my family 
    lived in poverty. We could not pay the rent in Germany. We became immigrants 
    and went to Italy. I finished high school and went to college in Switzerland. 
    
    After college, I began writing about science. I did not reach success in an 
    instant, though. At first, other scientists did not approve of my work. They 
    thought I was a failure. Rising to the rank of an admired scientist was a gradual 
    process. Soon, people started to notice that I was right. At last, I began to get 
    some recognition. 
    
    I showed how to find the approximate size of very big things, like stars. I also 
    detected and explained the movement of very small things, like atoms. And 
    
    for fun, I made a machine that could 
    refrigerate food by inserting 
    heat. I never retired. It 
    was my duty to keep

    different. Thomas was strict. He made his crew engage in difficult tasks. “Make 
    sure the ship’s deck is firm and that nothing falls! Put more fuel in the tank!” he 
    said. His ship was very plain, but he never had a problem with it. 
    
    The second captain, William, was not serious. He had a grand ship, and he 
    loved having fun. His crew amused him by singing and dancing. But his crew 
    never fixed anything on the ship. They just wanted to surf. 
    
    One day, Thomas saw a hurricane ahead. He knew that his ship needed to 
    turn around. But he was sure William did not see the storm. He adjusted the 
    dials on the radio and called his friend. Thomas said, “You’ll hit the reef. It’s 
    made completely of coral. Turn around to ensure that you do not crash.” 
    
    William said, “We will go under the deck and shut the door. We will dance 
    and sing until we are past the danger zone.” 
    
    When William’s ship got to the hurricane, the wind blew it into the reef. The 
    ship crashed, and water flowed below the deck. William’s 
    crew accused him of being 
    a bad captain. The 
    loss of the ship 
    taught William 
    a lesson. There 
    are times to 
    have fun, but 
    there are also 
    times to be serious.

  `  The Fisherman `,

   ` Every day, a fisherman sat on a bridge. He ate apples and spit the seeds 
    into the water. He had a simple way to catch fish. He cut a branch off of a tree 
    and tied a line to it. He put a sharp hook on it and made a tight knot. Then he 
    whispered, “Come here fish.” Like magic, the fish bit the hook. He put them in a 
    big net and took them home to make big pots offish soup from them. 
    
    One day, another man walked up to him. He said, “My name is George. I am 
    staying at the inn. I bet that I am a better fisherman than you. I will accompany 
    you today. I dare you to prove your skill!” The fisherman cast his line. 
    
    George had a lot of electronic tools. One machine gave him the virtual 
    locations offish. His rod weighed fish.
