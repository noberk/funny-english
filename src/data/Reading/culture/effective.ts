Entrepreneurs are always on a quest to win the race against time.As if that weren’t stressful enough, we also have to enhance our willpower and strengthen our self - discipline.If not, then all of the distractions flying around will stand in the way of us getting things done.

Since I’m an avid reader, I’ve learned over the years that the best way to improve my time management and productivity skills have been through books.Of course, it can be overwhelming when you’re searching online or browsing in a book store for literature that can assist you in living a more fruitful life.That’s why I’ve made the decision easier for you by sharing with the 15 best time management and productivity books of all time.

1. “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change” by Stephen R.Covey
First published in 1989, “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” is regularly considered the best book to read if you want to improve your productivity both professionally and personally.It focuses on developing new habits so that you can stay - on - track as opposed to eliminating bad habits.Most notably, defining your goals and priorities.

Covey uses the analogy of placing rocks, pebbles, and sand into a jar to help you define what’s really important.If you start by putting the little things, such as the pebbles or sand, the rocks won’t fit.However, if you begin with the rock there’s enough room for you to put the tinier items around them in the jar.
